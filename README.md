## Overview
- If anyone sees this I want to tell them not to give up, to keep developing, to keep learning, I know it's frustrating at first, I know it very well, but little by little you will see the great progress you are making and you won't believe everything you see. They are capable, no matter what happens, don't give up and keep developing <3.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Continued development

I want to continue developing some projects with CSS since it catches my attention and is something that I really like. I know I have a lot to learn and there are many more that I have to strengthen but I will continue to learn more and more. My future plan is to continue developing with increasingly complex technologies and you will surely see me here sharing my experiences with these technologies.


### Useful resources

- [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/) - It is a great free resource for people who are learning and has various technology courses and has a lot of useful information.
